# Kernel Modules and Character Device Drivers

## Kernel module
- A kernel module is a piece of code you can load into the Linux kernel (the core of the operating system) to add new functionality without restarting the system.
- Think of it like a USB plug-in for your computer—you plug it in to add a feature (e.g., controlling hardware) and unplug it when done.
- It lets you extend the kernel’s capabilities (e.g., add a driver for a new device) without modifying the entire kernel.
- You can load it with `insmod` and unload it with `rmmod`, making it great for testing or temporary features.
- Written in C and runs in “kernel space” (a privileged part of the OS with direct hardware access).
- Uses special functions like `module_init` (runs when loaded) and `module_exit` (runs when unloaded).

## Character Device Driver
- A character device is a special type of device in Linux that appears as a file (e.g., /dev/m_cdev) in the filesystem.
- User programs can interact with it by reading from or writing to it, like a regular file.
- A character device driver is a kernel module that creates a character device, which acts like a file (e.g., `/dev/m_cdev`) that user programs can interact with.
- User programs can write data to the device (send to the kernel) or read data from it (get from the kernel).
- It’s called a “character” device because it handles streams of data (not fixed-size blocks like a hard drive).
- Example: Writing “hello” to `/dev/m_cdev` sends it to the kernel, and reading from `/dev/m_cdev` might return “hello” back to the user.
- Kernel modules let you add custom functionality (like talking to hardware or creating devices) to Linux.
- Character device drivers provide a way for user programs (e.g., a command-line tool) to communicate with the kernel, making it easy to send or receive data.
